# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Problem Statement:
A telecommunications company wishes to forecast which customers are likely to churn in the near future.
They have gathered data on their customers, such as demographic information, account information and usage information and would like to use this 
information to build a model that can predict customer churn. 
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict customer churn based on available data.

The model is trained as follow:

1. Data Preprocessing: 
• Once we have a firm grasp on the dataset, we begin preprocessing it.
• Handling missing or inconsistent data points is a common preprocessing step.
• Scaling or normalising numerical characteristics.
• Using one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding to encode categorical features.
• Feature extraction or selection using techniques like PCA or LDA.

2. Model Selection: 
• Once the data has been preprocessed, we begin selecting a suitable model for the 
problem. There are several classification models that could be used such as:
• Logistic Regression
• Random Forest
• Neural Networks
• Support Vector Machines (SVM)
• To select the best model for the problem, we try out different models and evaluate 
their performance on the validation set.

3. Model Training: 
• Now that we've chosen a model, we train it on the preprocessed data. 
• To get the best performance on the validation set, we tune the model's 
hyperparameters.

4. Model Evaluation and training: 
• Once the model has been trained, we assess its performance on the test set. 
• To determine how well the model is performing, we compute the accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1 score.
• Now that we've chosen a model, we train it on the preprocessed data. To get the best 
performance on the validation set, we tune the model's hyperparameters
